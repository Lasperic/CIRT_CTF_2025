Description : I followed a lead to Tell el-Muqayyar and found a \"clay tablet\" that's clearly fake. It's covered with modern English scribbles in red Sharpie, and the thing is 3D-printed PLA. Plankton isn't doing archaeology; they're hiding something in the print. I've bagged the object and the photos. Please analyze them and try to find the containment code.

The triplets form the Babylonian triplets, better known as the Pythagorean theorem.

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
