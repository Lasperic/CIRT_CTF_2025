London

Description : We have a problem, boss: I extracted the containment code, put it into a container, password-protected it, and then forgot the password. I use the same password for everything, so try checking the memory file I sent you the other day; maybe you can recover it

Category : Memory Analysis

File : 


Use volatility to extract the password from the memory dump, then use that password to unpack the archive.
